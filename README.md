# Improve my code! 

This project aims to facilitate code-writing skills among bioinformatics researchers at Armenian Bioinformatics Institute (ABI). We are looking for programmers who would volunteer their time to provide mentorship to young bioinformatics researchers making their first steps in the world of programming. Some of the mentors working at a company that supports service-learning or dollar-for-doers (e.g. through Benevity and Global giving platforms) will have the opportunity to register their volunteer work and also get rewards to donate to organizations of their choice. 

## For mentors

Here you may find the list of our mentees. Under each mentee's folder, you may find a README explaining the mentee's background, their research focus and what kind of mentorship they are looking for, and the code snippets that they'd like to improve. After you choose your mentee, you can use this repo to review, edit and comment on their code. 

*Remember to register your volunteer work!* If you are working at a company that supports service-learning or dollar-for-doers (e.g. through Benevity and Global giving platforms) you can register your volunteer hours and get a financial reward, which will be donated to the company of your choice. 

## For mentees

Use this repo, if you are having trouble with either of the following: 
- Your code lacks reproducibility: you run it from time to time getting different results
- Your code lacks clarity: you cannot understand your code after a long break, or others cannot use your code
- Your code is not flexible: every time you want to add a new feature or modify your code, you have to spend too much time on changing it, and most of the times you end up breaking the code
- You don't know how to properly use git.
- Other? (Please add)

What you need to do: 
- Open a folder under your name.
- Add a README file, and fill it in with the following fields: your personal details (name, email, links to social media, contacts), your background, 1-2 sentences about your research focus, and what kind of support you are seeking. Remember, the mentors are not supposed to spend more than 40 hours on the mentorship. So your task is to formulate your ask as exact and clear as possible.
- Post the code snippets you're having trouble with.
